// The model viewer, and every resource it loads, all support the following events.
// They are all event emitters, and use the standard JS model of event emitters (on, off, emit).
// Since all resources are event emitters, it is very easy for the implementation to add its own events.
// For an example of this, the Mdx and M3 model instances send the 'seqend' event, every time an animation sequence finishes.

// A handler is an object that describes the neccassary properties to handle some resource.
// For example, the Bmp handler is a texture handler, and thus has a Texture getter, that returns the texture implementation BmpTexture.
// Every handler has a list of extensions that are linked to it, much like how extensions work on the operating system.
// When a resource is being loaded, the extension used will determine the handler.
// In this case, Bmp.extension is a getter that returns '.bmp'.
// If one handler handles multiple extensions, they can be added with pipe characters inbetween, like the Png handler's extension - '.png|.jpg|.gif'.
// Finally, the Bmp handler defines the binaryFormat getter to true, which means that any HTTP requests made for it will return an ArrayBuffer, instead of a string.
viewer.addHandler(handlers.bmp);

// Same deal as the above, but Obj is a model handler.
// Model handlers are slightly more complicated.
// The same idea of getters apply also here, but there are 4 implementation getters instead of 1.
// 1) Model - The model implementation (e.g. ObjModel).
// 2) ModelView (optional) - The model's view implementation (e.g. ModelView).
// 3) ModelInstance (optional) - The model instance implementation (e.g. ObjModelInstance).
// 4) Bucket (optional) - The model's bucket implementation (e.g. Bucket).
// Note that ModelView, ModelInstance, and Bucket, default to the base implementation - you are not required to define your own implementations if you don't need to.

// A path solver is used for every load call.
// The purpose of a path solver is to transform local paths to either of 1) A server fetch, or 2) A local load.
// A path solver must return the resource source, file extension, and whether it's a server fetch.
// The above are served as an array of [src, extension, serverFetch]
// This pathsolver returns the path prepended by 'resources/', to make the paths you supply to load calls shorter.
// It returns the extension of the path directly (assuming it's an actual file path!).
// Lastly, it says that this path is a server fetch.
// If the solver returns anything false-like for the third element, there will be no server fetch, and src will be directly sent to the implementation.
// This can be used if you want in-memory loads (e.g. see the W3x handler's path solver, which handles both server fetches and local loads for Warcraft 3 maps).

// Every viewer resource has a whenLoaded function, and the viewer itself has whenAllLoaded.
// These functions are much like attaching an event listener to the 'loadend' event, but it also calls the given callback if the resource was already loaded.
// ModelViewer.whenLoaded works the same way, but takes an array of resources instead, for cases where you want to wait for multiple resources to load before doing something.
// In this case, let's print that the texture was loaded, whenever it's actually loaded, and the time that passed.
