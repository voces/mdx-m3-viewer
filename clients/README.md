Over the years, many different clients were made with this library. Most of them have gone into the pages of forgotten history, but some remain.

I present them as-is, in their messy state, so that they may perhaps help anyone who wants to use the library, or for anyone wanting to improve them.

Note that if the web page you open doesn't point to `127.0.0.1` (e.g. you are using a remote server, or simply type `localhost` instead), all downloads will be redirected to the Hiveworkshop. Once upon a time Ralle, the Hive's owner, said he's ok with this. If at any point this changes, I will remove this information from the repository.
Due to this, for the time being, all of the clients should run out of the box.
